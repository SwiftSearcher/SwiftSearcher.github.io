uses subculture to destroy your browser. (you need to have popups enabled for this to work) What this does is very similar to youareanidiot. However this has more chance to destroy your computer because of the sheer amount of popups. PROCEED WITH CAUTION! This took me a couple hours cuz i just started coding. And yes, i know i used jsfiddle instead of actually coding a website, but do you want to prank the homies or not? I have exams in a couple weeks so that is why i did all the coding in jsfiddle, but that doesn't really matter. any ways SwiftSearcher.github.io is the link.
